## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to add custom fonts:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: Figtree;
  src: url(./assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf) format("truetype");
  font-weight: 100 900;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: Figtree;
  src: url(./assets/fonts/Figtree-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf) format(truetype);
  font-weight: 100 900;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

### Continued development

I think I still need to work on CSS in general. I did this project desktop first. I'll make sure the next one will be mobile first.

### AI Collaboration

I use ChatGPT for explanations, not to give me solutions. I usually try to first look things up online, mostly stack overflow. This takes more time, but I find that it allows me to think things through for myself, and I later remember what I've learned better. By the time I get to ChatGPT, I usually have some sort of an idea how the problem can be solved.
